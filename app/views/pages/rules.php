So for your own sake, do not try to cheat. 'Cause you will get caught, and you will be banned. Not just from ADC but also from other sites, as we share cheaters' IPs with other BitTorrent sites. Once you are out, you are out for good.</li><br>
<li> Breaking rules or ignoring staff directions will earn you a warning (<img src="./images/warned.gif">). A warning means you must be on your absolute best behavior while the warning is in effect.</li><br>
<li> Duplicate accounts are forbidden and will result in the banning of all related accounts. Two accounts are considered duplicates if the same person made them or they share the same IP. If you share an Internet connection with someone who wants to have their own ADC account, you must speak with a staff member about it; otherwise, we will be forced to assume that both accounts belong to you and that you are intentionally breaking the rules.<br>
<br>
Whether or not you share an Internet connection with anyone, you are allowed to share your account with somebody that you trust. Keep in mind that ultimately you are responsible for anything done with your account, so be smart about whom you let use your account.</li><br>
<li> <a href="<?php echo URL_ROOT . "/torrents";?>">Torrents with a golden chest</a> (<img src="./images/golden.gif">) are considered "free leech", which means downloading them will not affect your download stats, but uploading on a golden torrent will still count towards your upload stats. This means that your ratio can only get better when downloading golden torrents. They are a great place to start for new users worried about their ratio.<br>
Note: Golden torrents do not give you the right to hit-and-run, you must seed on them just as with any other torrent.</li><br>
<li> All users of this site must read and agree with the <a href="<?php echo URL_ROOT . "/useragreement";?>">user agreement</a>.</li></ul></span></td></tr>

                        <tr><td><span class="size2"><ul class="bbcode"><li>As an Asian DVD Club member, you are required to maintain at least a minimum share ratio. It is solely your responsibility to keep yourself above your minimum required ratio.</li><br>
<li>A sliding scale is used to calculate your required ratio, based on your total download amount. The more you download, the higher your required ratio becomes, until you reach the cap of <b>0.5</b>. No one is required to maintain a higher ratio than 0.5, regardless of how much they have downloaded.</li><br>
<li>The sliding scale uses a ratio factor of 200. Your minimum required ratio is calculated by taking your total download amount (in gigabytes) and dividing it by the scale's ratio factor. For example, if you have downloaded 49 GB, your minimum required ratio will be 49 divided by 200, which equals 0.245.</li><br>
<li>If you have downloaded less than 15 GB, you do not yet have any ratio requirements to fulfill. But once you reach 15 GB downloaded, the ratio requirements will take effect.</li><br>
<li>Failure to meet your required ratio will result in a warning (<img src="./images/warned.gif">). If you download too much while you are warned, you will have your download privileges removed, and you will then only be able to download golden torrents. Seeding and uploading new torrents will still be possible however.</li><br>
<li>Warned users who upload enough to reach their minimum required ratio will have their warning automatically removed in due time. If their download privileges were removed, those privileges will automatically be restored.</li><br>
<li>You will <b>never</b> be banned for simply having a bad ratio. Not even if it takes you months to get above your minimum required ratio.</li><br>
<li>For help on raising your ratio, please read the very helpful <b><a href="<?php echo URL_ROOT . "/forum";?>">Advice on How to Raise Your Ratio</a></b> thread.</li><br>
